# Project Start

Build a web browser game.

The game consists of:
- a snake which moves on the screen
- squares that show up on the screen for 3s at time, then disapper
- every time the head of the snake touches a square, it grows a little
- if the snake touches itself or the edges of the screen, it's Game Over
- the player controls the snake with the arrows of the keyboard

The game should run on my web browser.


# Debugging

There is a bug in the logic. The snake can die even when it doesn't touch itself or a wall. Explain what line of code is causing this bug.

Fix the error.

# 2

The game eats my inputs. If I press two keys in quick sequence, the first key press is ignored. Fix that by running the queued presses in order

# Improvements

Add a scoreboard. Add a timer. Make squares last 10s at the start, and every food eaten last 10% less. Increase speed of snake 10% after every food eaten.

# Styling

Make the scoreboard and timer colorful and larger. They should be on top of the gameboard, with some space between it and the game.

Also, increase the game board size 5x.

# Conclusion

Unbelivable quality.
